 I have worked on an interactive dashboard designed to extract insights from electric vehicle registrations, including filters for various parameters such as vehicle types, states, and models. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are discussed, focusing on the total number of electric vehicles and market growth trends.
Explanation of different KPIs like total vehicles, electric range, and types of electric vehicles including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrids (PHEV).
Demonstration of the filtering options in the dashboard, allowing users to explore data for specific models or states, such as Ford or California.
Discussion on how to create charts that will depict electric vehicle trends from 2011 to current, emphasizing year-on-year growth
Deliberation on the client's problem statement and the necessary KPIs that will guide the dashboard's design.
Instructions provided for users on data preparation, as it accounts for 70-80% of the work in data analysis projects.
Initial steps to connect data to Tableau, highlighting the type of data being used for analysis.
Breakdown of the dataset which includes necessary fields such as vehicle make, model, type, and eligibility criteria for clean alternative fuel vehicles.
Final remarks on ensuring data accuracy and the significance of examining the first 100 rows of data as part of preparing for analysis.
